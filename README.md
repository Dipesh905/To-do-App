# ToDoApp

This is a simple to do app made with the help of flutter and dart. Firebase is used as a backend and riverpod is used as statemanagement and project follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
User can add, edit or delete to dos. I have implemented firebase authentication with email and password in this project.

I have implemented few functionalities in the app such as validation,filtering to do lists, email and strong password validation, firebase authentication, loader, date time formatting, showing error or sucess dialogue in this project. This project might be helpful for flutter and dart begineers.
